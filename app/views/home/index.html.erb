      <p> Wadsworth House is private, comfortable and peaceful. The kitchen is large and fully outfitted. A cozy fireplace can warm up a cool evening. Cool off a hot mid-summer afternoon in the pool. The Gator makes Island exploration easy and fun. Lorie, who lives in the cottage close by is a perfect host, quickly taking care of any problems that might arise. We really enjoyed our stay! </p>
